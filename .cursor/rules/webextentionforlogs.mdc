# Idea -

our idea is to create a extention which takes permission to take logs from every website the user is using currently from his browser
our extention will take some logs / requests and send it via api live and as well as store it to the mongodb for further database access of logs


Start with Browser-Level Capture
Use chrome.webRequest (extension).
Log: URL, method, status, headers, response size/time
Here’s a sample JSON schema of a log entry:
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-23T12:34:56Z",
  "url": "https://example.com/api/v1/user",
  "method": "POST",
  "status_code": 200,
  "request_headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"
  },
  "request_body": {
    "username": "jatin",
    "password": "******"
  },
  "response_headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Content-Length": "245"
  },
  "response_body": {
    "id": "12345",
    "name": "Jatin"
  },
  "latency_ms": 312,
  "request_size_bytes": 420,
  "response_size_bytes": 245,
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.15",
  "protocol": "https",
  "error": null
}



Forward to Your API
Constant stream of request logs → stored in MongoDB/


✅ Summary:

Easy logs → Requests, responses, headers, bodies, timings, errors.

use database url for mongodb - mongodb+srv://reqlog:reqlog@reqlog.fvlzk2o.mongodb.net/reqlog?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=reqlog


create a chrome extention and tell me the testing process - and what things we cant do ? and what things we can do
