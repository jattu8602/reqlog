## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Content Script**: Runs on web pages, detects bots and monitors conversations
- **Background Script**: Manages extension state, processes messages, and handles notifications
- **Popup**: User interface for controlling the extension and viewing statistics

### Bot Detection Algorithm
The extension uses a scoring system to identify AI bots:
- **High-confidence indicators** (15 points): data attributes, specific IDs
- **Medium-confidence indicators** (8-12 points): class names, ARIA roles, structural patterns
- **Low-confidence indicators** (3 points): text content keywords
- **Threshold**: Elements need 12+ points to be classified as bots

### Privacy Risk Patterns
Uses regex patterns to detect requests for:
- Personal identifiers (name, age, location)
- Contact information (phone, email, address)
- Financial data (credit cards, bank accounts)
- Identity documents (SSN, passport, license)
- Sensitive questions (security questions, income)

## üö® Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All conversation analysis happens locally in your browser
- **No Data Collection**: The extension doesn't collect or transmit personal data
- **User Control**: You can disable monitoring at any time
- **Transparent**: All detected risks are clearly explained
